# luks-RAID-Setup
 luksRAIDSetup.sh is a Linux shell script designed for setting up a mirrored RAID array on two encrypted hard drives using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and mdadm. It automates the process of encrypting individual drives, creating a RAID 1 array with these encrypted devices, and preparing the array for use.
